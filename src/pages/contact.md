Hey there! Thanks for trying to get in touch.

The best way to reach me is by e-mail, via [hazel@hazelthats.me](mailto://hazel@hazelthats.me). I usually take at most a day to respond to messages there.

# Use of PGP
If you want to encrypt a message to me with PGP or use it to check signatures from me, you may import my public key as provided [here](/pubkey-hazel.asc). The fingerprint is `3860 5F46 3B24 CC18 5F40  BD33 03E5 7F0E 48DA 9477`. If you don't know what this is, you don't have to worry about it.
