I got a new job! I start in October, I'll be fulfilling the role of "Junior Consultant", but I'll essentially just be a Linux system administrator. Looks like overobsessing with a piece of software for a couple years panned out after all! I'm really looking forward to it, the team seems amazing, and I'll be colleagues with one of my best friends of the recent years.

I'm also looking forward to a major surgery, happening on September 2nd. This is one I've been waiting on since 2019. It'll take a lot of courage, nevermind a lot of recovery, but I'm sure it'll all have been worth it.
