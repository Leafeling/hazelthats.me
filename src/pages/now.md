I'm looking for a new workplace, and for opportunities to move out into the city. The latter is unfortunately, _wonderfully_ rare.

I'm working on a [game about nothing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QP6JRD8Zkx0), inspired by LSD Dream Emulator and the ÆŽNA web series. If completed, it will consist of an interconnected network of surreal dream worlds, traversable by rail and death.

Talk to me about: Vivziepop cartoons, Minecraft, LEGO.<br>
New watches: Neon Genesis Evangelion.
