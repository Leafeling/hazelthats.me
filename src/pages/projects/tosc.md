_Website made using TypeScript and React with the NextJS framework._

A collective advocating for libre software and a web built on transparency, started by two of my friends and myself. With The Open Source Company, I've designed the collective's website, and helped in designing Kards and Playrbase. The project has since been abandoned (we all found jobs).
